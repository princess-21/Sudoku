# Sudoku
Boot camp project
 
This is a simple Sudoku puzzle solver implemented in JavaScript. The program allows the user to input a Sudoku puzzle row by row, and it will solve the puzzle, displaying the solution.

## Features
- Accepts user input for a Sudoku puzzle (9x9 grid).
- Solves the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- Displays the solved Sudoku grid.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project folder in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node sudo.js
   Testing
In the future, we plan to add automated tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Sudoku Solver. Tests will be written using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework.

Planned Steps to Set Up Testing:
Install Jest: Install Jest using npm to set up the testing environment.
Write Tests: Develop test cases to validate the functionality of the Sudoku solver, including checking for valid inputs and solving the puzzle correctly.
Run Tests: Use Jest to run the test cases and verify the solution.
